            <h2>Software and Skills</h2>
            <p><strong>Linux</strong> - When I was about 10 years old, my dad brought my first desktop computer home from work. It didn't have a soundcard, and I broke it almost instantly by going administrator mode and deleting critical files. It wasn't long before I began using Ubuntu at a very basic level. At around 20 I switched from Ubuntu to Arch Linux, and very recently I've switched to NixOS as it best enables an infrastructure-as-code approach at the OS level.</p>
            <p><strong>Shell Scripting</strong> - I've never had a problem writing shell scripts, but every time I read someone else's code I wonder if I don't really understand it.</p>
            <p><strong>Votebuilder / VAN / NGP</strong> - I know it in and out. Been working with the software since I started my career.</p>
            <p><strong>SQL</strong> - I consider myself to basically be 'done' with learning SQL. BigQuery has a number of additions that I continue to discover and find useful, but I can take cleaned data and construct a schema with only a little brainstorming.</p>
            <p><strong>R</strong> - Probably the single language I know best, especially the tidyverse ecosystem. I use it as an exploratory language, like shell scripting for data science.</p>
            <p><strong>Python</strong> - I wouldn't say I know Python 'well', but I can do basic plumbing with it. For situations where you have a RESTful API and need to regularly load data into SQL, it's about the perfect choice. For nearly anything else, I use something higher (R or Shell Scripting) or lower (Haskell) level.</p>
            <p><strong>Haskell</strong> - C for math majors and people who like the functional programming over procedural. Learning it has been incredibly rewarding, but I wouldn't say it's a particularly useful language.</p>
            <p><strong>QGIS</strong> - I feel like I've done a thousand different things in QGIS and haven't even scratched the surface. Every time I approach it with a new project I end up exploring a new feature or plugin.</p>
            <p><strong>Tableau / Looker Studio</strong> - Grouping these together to say that I know how to dashboard, and understand the benefits of dashboard-mindset when it comes to data communication.</p>
